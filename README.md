# Flat Surface Calibration
Compute calibration for projection on flat surface, to sidestep affine
distortions. In short, compute a homography. Take projection I' of 
image I. For any point p' on I', this repository allows you to find the
corresponding point p on I.

Below is a demo that uses this "flat surface calibration".
