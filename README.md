# Flat Surface Calibration
Compute calibration for projection on flat surface, to sidestep affine
distortions. In short, compute a homography. This repository offers
two main utilities:
- Take projection I' of image I. For any point p' on I', find the
 corresponding point p on I.
- Take projection I' of image I. Adjust the projection so that I'
 appears undistorted.
